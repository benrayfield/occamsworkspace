	(which are sandboxed) into various optimized systems including the acyclicFlow music tools optimization
	and forest of opencl ops and some kinds of code compile to javassist andOr beanshell.
	The generated code will still implement the rules of the sandbox but this
	ForestOp layer wont try to verify that. This ForestOp layer should only run trusted code.
	Trusted code will be generated from [untrusted code in a trusted sandbox] that way.
