Watches a download of a file or URL many times as more and more bytes are downloaded.
During the download, those bytes can be accessed by an InputStream.
After the download, all the bytes are returned as a byte[] array.

Specifies when updates should be given and what to do when the download ends correctly or in error.
Specifies how long to wait in total and after each incremental download, before ending in error.

NEED TO ADD InputStream parameters parallel to String fileNameOrURL.
Or move that to a different interface?
