/** This is created normally by a string in listweb or typed in right column,
under which this JPanel appears. As Consumer, it gets that first string from one of the tabs
in the right column, and any updates it gets from the other tab, both of which
contain a textarea thats autofilled by listweb def but can be edited in the right column.
Calling Consumer.accept(Object) again is optional.
Consumer.accept(Object) is normally that String but later could be other object types
such as immutable.occamsfuncer.Funcer or JsonDS map.
An example of editing that is to change learningRate in RBM.
