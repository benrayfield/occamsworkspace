Instead it should converge to some near constant lstm weights. So I'm going to use a simpler testcase, recurrentjavaSwapstateLstmOn1dViewOfChuasCircuit using the same ui but having chuasCircuit choose mouse position.\n\nInputs are now-timewindowsize to now-chaostime,and outputs are now-timewindowsize to now, so it cant cheat by using now to predict now.\n*/",
